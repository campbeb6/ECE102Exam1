 guess_xml.xml is the predictor output file.
 benchmark3.xml is the input user database file i used. 
 
 My predictor calculated the total number of views for each movie title, saved the title and its views into an object, used the object to calculate the 4 most viewed videos, and recommended the top 4 most viewed movies to every user. This is essentially the "Popular on Netflix" section you will see in your netflix homescreen.
